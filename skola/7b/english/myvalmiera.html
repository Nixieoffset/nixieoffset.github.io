<h1>Project: My Valmiera</h1>

<p>At this year's April, English teacher Iveta Glužģe decided to make an assignment of making a short film. We were given two months to deal with assembling the team, writing the scenario and filming the movie. </p> 
<br>

<fieldset>
<legend><h3>The scenario <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" data-toggle="modal" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i_KA9-SSs9Af0Y_h0jCtCeXD_7Ufdk61WqvSAMHouA8/edit">View</a></h3></legend>
<p>When the team was assembled, we got to the writing. In the beginning, there was no activity from others, so I as elected director started discussing the themes we'd be exploring at our Whatsapp group.</p> 

<p>This approach was successful because sometimes Daniel came to help, Markuss helped too but more rarely than him so the project was working nicely. But then problems happened. Although Raivis doesn't do anything but use computer all day after school, he didn't ever came into the script much to our disappointment. That disturbed us from writing his lines as we weren't able to know how experienced he was with Valmiera's landmarks - he came into our school only at Grade 6, and he was usually homeschooled at Zilaiskalns. </p> 
<p>
Time passed by and he still wasn't contributing so I got the teacher to intervene. That escalated to such level that he started crying, but at least that helped - at the free days he came into the scenario and did small changes. Soon we sent the script to teacher, but we redrafted it a few more times. The interesting fact is that we were the only ones who submitted our script in time. </p> 
</fieldset>
<br>

<legend><h3>The filming</h3></legend>
<p>The process of filming wasn't as satisfactory as scenario. The time for sessions were very limited because Daniel and Markuss had a lot of after-school activities and Raivis didn't live in Valmiera and came to school only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. </p>  

<p>The first session was at one weekend's evening when Markuss, Daniel and I met at the cinema to film the entertainment part of the film. This took a really long time because Daniel couldn't get himself to act appropriate and he ruined a few takes. Our other classmate, Kristers, who was in an other group came too and helped with the camera. At the end when we finally forced Daniel to behave, I was already driven insane by dealing with his shenanigans and couldn't do the scene normally. Then we did the mini-intro: Daniel begged a piece of popcorn to some men at the cinema and we got one take of a funny intro where he ate popcorn and made funny faces. (also, in the director's cut this session's failures are chronologically reverse, sorry about that) </p> 

<p>In one other day everyone did go to the Valleta and tried to film. This time there were disturbances too. I got tired of trying to get them to behave so after there came some guys and asked what are we filming (ruining a good take), I lashed out at my groupmates. </p> 

<p>The school part went mostly okay - Raivis needed to go to home so that was a little rushed. </p> 

<p>Markuss was a big problem in the filming - he wasn't coming at most sessions because he had "mandatory" horseback riding lessons that he "couldn't" skip. This usually made the filming impossible because he was one of the main cast, so we got the teacher to intervene again, but she scolded <b>ME</b> for <b>HIS</b> mistakes, so I got that she's not useful anymore. These Markuss' pieces of weirdness postponed the film to the last day of submission, so we were forced to leave out two scenes and go to the church tower to do the intro and the outro. We even considered calling his mother as she would've prevented him from coming to the stables instead of filming (because film was a "blue test") but we didn't do so. Because of all that he did to us, we kicked him out of the cast resulting in obsoleteness of the last scenes. He tried to complain to the teacher at the day of presentation and I got to my defense stance, but after she heard our rant about all he did - he got a really bad grade (I think it was 3) - he got what he deserved. </p>

<legend><h3>The presentation</h3></legend>
<p>The day came and we started presenting the film. Most of class got grades ranging from 6 to 8, but only Felisa&Ance got a 9, because they memorized everything. I don't think that such bad grades were needed just because people with 6x longer scripts than them couldn't memorize such poems. After Kamilla tried to defend her group, teacher started rudely screaming at her, almost causing me to lash out saying "If you think that your blabbering about time management, memorizing and teamwork is true, then maybe you should make this film yourself and then make assumptions!". Thankfully I didn't because I couldn't get the right moment. One thought still haunts me to this day: Was the feud, problems, our wasted hours of work really worth the price of getting a 7!? </p>
